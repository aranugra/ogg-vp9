# VP9 inside OggMapping of WebM codec inside Ogg container has been specified sincethe [introduction of the WebM][1] <sup>[archived][9]</sup> that refer to a document describing _"Ogg container format mapping for WebM"_, and implementationsof VP8 inside Ogg is already implemented by [ffmpeg][3],development version of [liboogz][4] and some other softwares.Some time later google release VP9, but no software that support VP9 inside Ogg yet.Firefox [documentation claim that][5] <sup>[archived][8]</sup> they can play VP8 and VP9 inside Ogg.Contrary to their documentation though, Firefox in fact can *not* play Ogg with VP8 codec(tested on Firefox version 104.0.1). On related note, Google Chrome and MS Edge dosupport VP8 inside Ogg. I can not test whether they can play VP9 inside Ogg because I can not even able to find any software that can put VP9 inside Ogg.Because lack of OggVP9 implementation, for learning purpose, I am interested to implement it.## 1. OggVP9 MappingHere is what I found while searching for the elusive document describing  _"Ogg container format mapping for WebM"_- The mapping document on the [aftermentioned article][1] <sup>[archived][9]</sup> is now inaccessible- The [Xiph Wiki][6] also have no mention of it, which is understandable since they are not Xiph codecs- A bit searching I found this [PDF document][2] which I believe is the same document linked on the articleFrom there I am implementing OggVP9 mostly using the same mapping as OggVP8 with VP9 specific changes- The `ID` field is (obviously) set to `VP90`- VP9 pts always increasing regardless visible or invisible frame, this also true for VP9 inside IVF formatMore detail is written in [this document](OggVP9.md).## 2. Building codeMy implementation is just a small patch for FFmpeg. All patches licensed under LGPL same as FFmpeg.However the code is _highly experimental_ and might contains serious bugs. Use it at your own risk.### 2.1. DependenciesTo build from source you should install at least gcc, yasm, and development version of these libraries- libvpx- libopus- libvorbis- libtheora- sdl2### 2.2. Patch FFmpegThis patch should work on FFmpeg 5.1, and may also work with more recent version of FFmpeg.    $ git clone https://github.com/aranugra/ogg-vp9.git    $ wget http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-5.1.tar.xz    $ tar -xf ffmpeg-5.1.tar.xz    $ patch -p1 -d ffmpeg-5.1 < ogg-vp9/ffmpeg/vp9-inside-ogg.patch### 2.3. Configure, build and installConfigure and build FFmpeg    $ OGGVP9_PREFIX=/opt/ffmpeg-5.1-ogg-vp9    $ cd ffmpeg-5.1    $ ./configure --prefix=$OGGVP9_PREFIX --enable-libvpx --enable-libopus --enable-libtheora --enable-libvorbis --enable-shared    $ make -j3    $ make installThen add `$OGGVP9_PREFIX/bin` to path if necessary.### 2.3. Prebuilt versionFor convenience, prebuilt version eventualy will be available on the release page, at least for Windows platform.## 3. Sample Use### 3.1. EncodingEncoding with constant rate factor    $ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -f ogg -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 0 -c:a libopus -b:a 160k output.ogvGenerally you can refer to [VP9 encoding guide][7] and just replace`-f webm` to `-f ogg` and replace output extension to `.ogv`.### 3.2. PlayingTo play resulting video, you can use `ffplay`    $ ffplay output.ogvYou can build real video player linked against this version of FFmpeg as the engine.For example [mpv][10]. In turn you can use [SMPlayer][11] as mpv front-end.## 4 LimitationKnown limitation on current implementation- Does not support any features of VP9 that only supported by matroska container (alpha, WebTTV, etc, etc)- No VP9 codec private information[1]: https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2010/05/19/webm-and-gstreamer/[2]: https://people.freedesktop.org/~slomo/ogg-vp8/ogg-vp8.pdf[3]: https://ffmpeg.org[4]: https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/liboggz[5]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers[6]: https://wiki.xiph.org/Ogg[7]: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/VP9[8]: http://web.archive.org/web/20220830180037/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers[9]: http://web.archive.org/web/20211026055813/https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2010/05/19/webm-and-gstreamer/[10]: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv[11]: https://github.com/smplayer-dev/smplayer
